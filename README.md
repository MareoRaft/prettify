# prettify

An Alfred Workflow that takes a JSON string from the clipboard and pretty prints it.  Please contact me if you would like to use this tool.

Hopefully we can support more strings in the future.  The JSON format is a bit too strict.  I hope to support barewords and trailing commas so that a plain printed JavaScript object could be pretty printed too.

For now I'm just dumping the code here.
